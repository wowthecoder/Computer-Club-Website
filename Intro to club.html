   <p class="prgrph">The Computer Club provides students in Wesley Methodist School Kuala Lumpur(International) with the opportunity to learn new digital skills in a fun and informal learning environment.</p>
   <p class="prgrph">The Computer Club is one of the most popular club in the school.Every year, we have over 200 participants from Year 7 to 11, split into 4 classes with about 50 students in each. 
   The course featured a modular learning approach comprised of knowledge and usage of various popular computer applications, coding, video game designing and more.</p>
   <p class="prgrph">The Computer Club’s informal approach and emphasis on making things as opposed to learning things help the participants acquire new skills through “stealth learning”;
    making video games helped with mathematics and group work, presenting projects helped with confidence and socialising, coding enhanced concentration skills and cultivated a persistent attitude.</p>
	<img src="http://ccc.creativecomputerclub.com/resources3.jpg" width="600px" height="350px" style="margin: 30px 28%;">
	<p class="prgrph">The courses provided are carefully chosen and arranged in order to offer club members knowledge on various areas of computing, such as website development, digital animation, 
	photo and video editing, video game designing, computer programming and much more. Knowledge on these areas of computing are supremely useful nowadays as we are living in the age of technology.
	Acquiring knowledge on these areas of computing will benefit the students tremendously in the future as this knowledge will enable them to apply for jobs like software engineer, web developer, 
    video game designer, mobile application developer, digital artist, database administrator and a lot more that offer high salary. The courses will be taught by the experienced senior board members. Experts 
	on these areas of computing will be invited to the club meetings occasionally to guide the members further.</p>	
	<p class="prgrph">Other than the weekly classes, we also provide members with further resourses to continue learning and using, long after that particular module has run. The courses are pitched at absolute beginners 
	and allow for participants to develop even further outside of the sessions. The resources will be published free online allowing them to download, learn and re-do the activities at home, and is key to the success
	of the participants rapid learning. </p>
